# Шτookωвiнα

*Шτookωвiнα is on beta-testing stage. Please give it a try.*

This program is designed to be useful for learners of foreign
languages. Some features of Шτookωвiнα for a quick start:

* it uses audio recordings from [Shtooka Project](http://shtooka.net/),
  these recordings are made by native speaking volunteers rather than
  robots;

* it has minimalistic command line interface that still tries to be friendly
  with help of [cl-readline](https://github.com/mrkkrp/cl-readline) and
  [cl-ansi-term](https://github.com/mrkkrp/cl-ansi-term);

* it has various exercises that help user work on different aspects of
  remembering a word: translation, writing, and listening;

* it also has «crossword» exercise;

* it's fully hackable via configuration script written in Common Lisp, user
  can define new commands and change absolutely everything in Шτookωвiнα;

* this program doesn't make any assumptions about «target» language, this
  allows to add definitions of new languages very easily;

* language of user interface also can be specified, new translations are
  made by copying of existing UI language definition and editing list of
  strings;

* for users that don't know Common Lisp there is Wizard that can configure
  most of parameters;

* there's also a built-in tutorial.

## Building and Installation

Installation process is pretty straightforward:

1. Install [SBCL](http://www.sbcl.org/), Шτookωвiнα is written in standard
   Common Lisp and it doesn't rely on any specific features of SBCL, however
   only version compiled with SBCL is tested and guaranteed to work;

2. Install [Quicklisp](http://www.quicklisp.org/) to automatically get all
   dependencies, in short, here is what to do:

   ```
   $ curl -O http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
   $ sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp
   * (quicklisp-quickstart:install)
   * (quit)
   ```

3. Install [Buildapp](http://www.xach.com/lisp/buildapp/);

4. Download or clone Шτookωвiнα's repo:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/mrkkrp/shtookovina.git master
   ```

5. `cd` into the directory and `make` the program:

   ```
   $ cd shtookovina
   $ make
   ```

6. Now you should have Шτookωвiнα's binary `build/shtk`, you can install it
   this way:

   ```
   # sh install.sh
   ```

7. Done (you can use `uninstall.sh` to uninstall the program).

## How to Start Шτookωвiнα?

Шτookωвiнα can be used to learn several languages at once. Thus it must keep
different dictionaries and configuration files for every «target»
language. You specify the language with option `-t` or `--target`:

```
$ shtk -t en # if you want to learn English
```

This option is mandatory. When adding new languages please refer to
[ISO 639-2](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) when
choosing their two-letter codes.

## Wizard and Audio

Now, you hopefully has installed Шτookωвiнα. However, it should be
configured before you can use it. Initially Шτookωвiнα was planned as a
hardcore program for Lisp geeks, but later I decided to make it more
user-friendly, so more people could use it. To make Шτookωвiнα work you're
supposed to write some Lisp in your configuration file setting some
variables and defining some hooks. Fortunately, we have wizard that can do
this automatically.

![Шτookωвiнα Wizard](img/wizard.png)

When you start Шτookωвiнα for the first time, wizard will be called (unless
you start it with `--no-wizard` option). First it asks about interface
language in English (it's default language, Шτookωвiнα will use your
preferred language as soon as it knows which one it is).

Second, Шτookωвiнα needs to know where audio databases are located in your
system. Шτookωвiнα uses databases from Shtooka project and for speed they
should be downloaded and placed in one directory. You can download the
databases from
[http://download.shtooka.net/](http://download.shtooka.net/). Don't forget
to uncompress the archives.

Third, the wizard will ask your how you would like to play audio files
(Shtooka project uses FLAC files). You should choose between listed options.

Finally, to use `query` and `conj` commands (open web-page with description
of given word or conjugation of given verb) you currently need to manually
edit relevant hooks in your configuration files, since we cannot know which
web-service your prefer to use for this task, and thus we cannot know how to
transform the word into URL.

## Tutorial

Шτookωвiнα has built-in interactive tutorial that shows basic commands:

![Шτookωвiнα Tutorial](img/tutorial.png)

The following topics are covered:

* How to find new commands and explore features of the program?

* How to get full description of any command?

* How to add words and phrases to user's dictionary?

* What sort of exercises can be used to remember these words?

* How to display information about the whole dictionary and detailed
  information about some specific entries?

## How to contribute?

There are many ways to help the project:

* define your language if it's missing, see `langs` directory for
  instructions and examples;

* translate user interface, see `ui-langs` directory for instructions and
  examples;

* translate this `README.md` file, append two-letter code of your language
  to the filename like this `README-fr.md` (for French);

* if you have encountered a bug, please
  [open an issue](https://github.com/mrkkrp/shtookovina/issues).
