# How to Define Missing Language?

Create new file, its name should consist of two-letter code of new language
(see [ISO 639-2](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php))
and `.lisp` suffix.

Files from this folder are loaded on start of Шτookωвiнα to set target
language (language that user wishes to learn). Every such a file contains
invocation of `set-language` function. Here is description of the function:

```
set-language name lexemes
```

This function generates and sets language for learning. Such a form must be
evaluated before any exercises take place. `name` is a string — name of the
language. `lexemes` is a list where every element is of form `(keyword
l-name &rest params)`, where `keyword` is keyword for internal use and
`l-name` is name of lexeme (string). This lexeme will have «self-sufficient
forms» that supplied with `:ss-forms` key argument (in `params`), all others
forms will be generated by concatenation of all possible combinations of
«form aspects» as supplied with `:form-aspects` keyword. However, order of
«form aspects» will be preserved.

See definitions of other languages for reference.
