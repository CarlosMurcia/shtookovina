 :tutorial-0
 "[Welcome to Шτookωвiнα](hdr), program that will help you to learn
[~](arg). In Шτookωвiнα you enter commands and their arguments to make
various things happen. This way you can add words to your dictionary and
edit them, run various exercises with these words, and other interesting
things. Every command is thoroughly documented, so the first thing you
should learn about this environment is how to discover new commands and get
description of command you're interested in. [help](cmd) command comes in
handy here. Try to call it without arguments now."
 :tutorial-1
 "[Great!](hdr) As you can see there are quite a few commands available in
Шτookωвiнα. Pick any of them and call [help](cmd) command with name of the
command as an argument, for example [help](cmd) [help](arg)."
 :tutorial-2
 "[Fantastic!](hdr) Now, that you know how to explore the environment, you
can continue on your own, but we would like to show you how to add words to
your dictionary first. Use command [add](cmd) to do so. If you check it with
help of [help](cmd) [add](arg) command, you will see that it takes four
arguments! Understand what to pass to [add](cmd) command and add first word
to your dictionary."
 :tutorial-3
 "[Fine!](hdr) Now add [11](arg) more words of different types. You should
have [12](arg) words in your dictionary to continue with this tutorial. Note
that you can get some statistic with help of [dict](cmd) command. This
command can be used to display statistic about some specific words that
share common prefix. Pass that prefix as first argument to [dict](cmd)
command to use this functionality."
 :tutorial-4
 "[12 words should be enough](hdr) to start our training. Шτookωвiнα has
several exercises to train different aspects of word recognition:
[translation](typ), [writing](typ), and [listening](typ). It even has some
sort of crossword game! You can use specific commands to start any of these
exercises, but we advise you use [train](cmd) command that tries to provide
comprehensive training experience using all these exercise in the right
order. Call [train](cmd) command without arguments."
 :tutorial-5
 "[So, that's how Шτookωвiнα can help you remember words.](hdr) There are
statistic per word that helps Шτookωвiнα determine which words need more
training. Call [dict](cmd) command and see for yourself that you've made
some progress!"
 :tutorial-6
 "[Not bad at all!](hdr) Шτookωвiнα supports other functionality too. You
can teach it how to lookup definition and/or translation of given word in
online dictionaries. You can also reprogram Шτookωвiнα putting some code
into your configuration file. You can even define new commands, etc. This
tutorial has shown you very basic commands and I fear it's come to its
end. To exit the interactive environment use [quit](cmd). Good luck!"
